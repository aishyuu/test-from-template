# marrow
A rich, barebones start to a JavaScript web project

# Motivation
There are a lot of web templates that include these fancy shmancy libraries and frameworks, but what about those who want to hone their fundamentals with some good ol javascript, while having industry standard tools? That's where the idea of marrow came.

## Goal
The goal with marrow is to provide the most barebones and lightweight way to get started with a javascript front-end web development project. In particular I want to include.

- Webpack with basic configuration for the most common files (css, fonts, images, and csv/json)
- ESLint and Prettier configuration with the Airbnb style guide
- A basic file structure to get going as quick as possible
